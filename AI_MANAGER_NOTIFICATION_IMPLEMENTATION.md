A warm, intelligent notification that appears automatically when users visit the dashboard, guiding them based on their acquisition status.

---

## **🎯 FEATURES**

- **Personalizes messages** based on:
  - User's display name (e.g., "Good afternoon, Muhammad!")
  - Time of day (morning/afternoon/evening greeting)
  - Number of platforms acquired (0, 1, or multiple)

Messages designed to be:
- ✨ Friendly and welcoming ("I'm completely yours", "I'm all here for you")
- 💪 Encouraging and motivating
- 🎯 Action-oriented with clear next steps
- 🤗 Building relationship with user

### **3. Smart Behavior**
- **Appears 2 seconds after page load** (feels natural, not intrusive)
- **Clickable notification opens AI Manager chat** instantly
- **Dismissible** with X button
- **Session-based** - dismissed state persists during session
- **Non-blocking** - doesn't interfere with navigation

### **4. Beautiful Design**
- **Animated entrance** with spring physics
- **Glowing border effect** that pulses
- **Floating AI robot avatar** with glow
- **Sparkle animation** for visual appeal
- **Responsive** - adapts to mobile devices

## **🔒 TECHNICAL DECISIONS**

### **Why Backend R2 Integration?**
- **Accurate:** Uses same source as main dashboard
- **Reliable:** No localStorage staleness issues
- **Scalable:** Works for billions of users
- **Dynamic:** Real-time platform status

### **Why Session Storage?**
- **Non-intrusive:** Dismissed notification doesn't reappear this session
- **Reappears:** Shows again next session (good for engagement)
- **Not persistent:** Doesn't clutter localStorage

### **Why 2-Second Delay?**
- **Natural timing:** Not instant (feels spammy)
- **Allows page load:** Dashboard renders first
- **User attention:** User has settled in by then

### **Why Random Messages?**
- **Variety:** Users don't see same message every time
- **Fresh:** Keeps experience interesting
- **Personality:** Makes AI feel more human
