# Canvas Editor Save Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Description
Canvas Editor's "Save Changes" functionality was failing with error:
```
Failed to save edited post. Please try again.
[Canvas] Error saving edited post: Error: Failed to save edited post
```

The error was occurring because the frontend was sending requests to `/api/save-edited-post` but the endpoint wasn't being routed correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Server Architecture
- **Port 3000** (`server/server.js`): Main server - webhooks, social media, user management
- **Port 3001** (`rag-server.js`): RAG server - AI/ML operations  
- **Port 3002** (`server.js`): Proxy server - image processing, post editing
- **Port 5173** (Vite): Frontend dev server with proxy routing

### The Problem
1. The `save-edited-post` endpoint was correctly implemented in `server.js` (port 3002)
2. However, the frontend Vite proxy configuration was missing a specific route for `/api/save-edited-post`
3. So requests to `/api/save-edited-post` were falling through to the default `/api/` rule
4. Which routed them to port 3000 instead of port 3002
5. Port 3000 server didn't have this endpoint, causing "Cannot POST" errors

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Vite Proxy Configuration
Added specific routing for the save-edited-post endpoint in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
// Save edited post endpoint (port 3002) - Image processing server
'/api/save-edited-post': {
  target: 'http://127.0.0.1:3002',
  changeOrigin: true,
  secure: false,
},
```

This ensures that during development, requests to `/api/save-edited-post/*` are correctly routed to the proxy server on port 3002.

## Verification

### Development Testing
```bash
# Direct test to port 3002 (works)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/save-edited-post/testuser -F "image=@test.jpg" -F "postKey=test"
# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Post edit saved successfully",...}

# Through Vite proxy (now works)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/save-edited-post/testuser -F "image=@test.jpg" -F "postKey=test"  
# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Post edit saved successfully",...}
```

### Production Configuration
Production nginx configuration was already correctly routing `/api/save-edited-post/` to port 3002:
```nginx
location ^~ /api/save-edited-post/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3002;
    # ... proxy headers
}
```

## Result
✅ Canvas Editor save functionality now works correctly in both development and production
✅ Users can edit posts in Canvas Editor and save changes successfully
✅ No changes required to backend code - only routing configuration fixed

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts`: Added save-edited-post routing rule

## Architecture Notes
The save-edited-post endpoint belongs on the proxy server (port 3002) because:
- It handles image processing and optimization
- It manages R2 storage operations for edited images
- It maintains the image cache invalidation system
- It fits the architectural separation where port 3002 handles all image-related operations
