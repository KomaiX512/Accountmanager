# 🚨 CRITICAL TEST - AI MANAGER VISIBILITY

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Navigation Options EXPANDED
```
Added 12 new destinations:
- home, homepage
- privacy, privacy-policy  
- terms, terms-of-service
- about, contact, help, support

```

**Now you can say:** "Navigate to privacy policy" ✅

### Fix 2: Super Visible DEBUG Mode
```css
- Red border around character (3px solid red)
- Red background (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2))
- Red "AI" label above button
- Z-index: 999999
- All !important flags
- Forced visibility: visible
- Forced opacity: 1
```

## 🧪 WHAT TO DO NOW

### Step 1: Stop Dev Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal
```

### Step 2: Start Fresh
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Open Browser
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 4: Login (if not already)
Your account dashboard should load

### Step 5: Look BOTTOM-RIGHT Corner

**YOU MUST SEE ONE OF THESE:**

**Option A: Element IS Visible**
```
✅ Red box with "AI" label (80px × 80px)
✅ 3D character with eyes inside
✅ Pulsing cyan glow around it
```

**Option B: Element NOT Visible BUT...**
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for:
   "🤖 AIManagerChat RENDERED"
   "🤖 AI Manager Gemini initialized"
4. If you see these → Component IS rendering but CSS is hiding it
5. If you DON'T see these → Component NOT rendering at all
```

**Option C: Check DOM**
```
1. F12 → Elements tab
2. Ctrl+F to search
3. Search for: "ai-character-container"
4. Found? → Element exists, CSS issue
5. Not found? → React not rendering it
```
