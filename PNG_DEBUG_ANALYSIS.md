🎯 PNG IMAGE WHITE PLACEHOLDER - ANALYSIS

✅ DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE:
   • PNG downloads perfectly from Ideogram (1.5MB, valid PNG signature)
   • Image validation and buffer operations work correctly
   • Problem is NOT in download or image processing

🔍 LIKELY ROOT CAUSES:
   1. **R2 Upload Issue**: PNG buffer corrupted during upload
   2. **Content-Type Mismatch**: Serving PNG with wrong headers
   3. **Placeholder Overwrite**: JPEG placeholder logic interfering with PNG
   4. **Caching Issue**: Old cached version being served

🔧 IMPLEMENTED FIXES:
   ✅ Added PNG format debugging (first 8 bytes logging)
   ✅ Fixed PNG validation (complete 4-byte signature check)
   ✅ Added R2 upload debugging (key, content-type, size)
   ✅ Added original-size metadata for verification

🎯 NEXT STEPS:
   1. Generate a new post to see debug logs
   2. Check if PNG is uploaded correctly to R2
   3. Verify content-type and metadata
   4. Test direct R2 URL access

⚠️  IMPORTANT:
   The image generation is working perfectly - the issue is in storage/serving.
   Next test will show exactly where the corruption occurs.
