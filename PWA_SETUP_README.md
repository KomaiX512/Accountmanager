# PWA Setup Guide for Sentient Marketing

Your website has been converted to a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on mobile devices!

## What's Been Added

1. **`public/manifest.json`** - Defines your app's appearance and behavior
2. **`public/service-worker.js`** - Handles caching and offline functionality  
3. **`public/pwa-register.js`** - Manages PWA installation and registration
4. **Updated `index.html`** - Added PWA meta tags and manifest links
5. **`scripts/generate-pwa-icons.js`** - Script to generate required icon sizes

## Quick Setup

### 1. Generate PWA Icons (Two Options)

#### Option A: Simple Setup (No Dependencies)
```bash
node scripts/simple-pwa-setup.js
```
This creates basic icons from your existing logo without additional software.

#### Option B: High-Quality Icons (Requires ImageMagick)
First, install ImageMagick:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install imagemagick

# macOS
brew install imagemagick

# Windows: Download from https://imagemagick.org/
```

Then run the high-quality icon generator:
```bash
node scripts/generate-pwa-icons.js
```

Both options will create icons in `public/icons/` from your existing `Logo/logo.png`.

### 2. Test Your PWA

1. **Build and serve your app** (make sure it's accessible via HTTPS)
2. **Open on mobile device** or use Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
3. **Look for the install prompt** - it should appear automatically
4. **Install the app** - it will appear on your home screen
