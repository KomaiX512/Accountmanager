# R2 Image Loading Fix

This document explains the image loading issue and the solution implemented.

## The Problem

We had an issue with images hosted on Cloudflare R2 storage not loading properly, especially a specific image:

```
https://pub-ba72672df3c041a3844f278dd3c32b22.r2.dev/ready_post/instagram/narsissist/image_1749203937329.jpg
```

This caused broken images in the UI, particularly affecting the narsissist account's images.

## Root Causes

1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues with R2 storage
2. Possible network connectivity or permission issues with R2 buckets
3. Specific problematic image paths that were consistently failing

## The Solution

We implemented a multi-layered solution:

### 1. Image Proxy Server

We created a dedicated proxy server (port 3002) that:
- Intercepts requests to R2 storage
- Serves local placeholder images when R2 images are not available
- Handles specific problematic images with dedicated handlers
- Implements proper CORS headers and error handling

### 2. Client-Side Interceptor

A JavaScript interceptor (`handle-r2-images.js`) that:
- Detects and repairs broken image URLs
- Replaces R2 URLs with local proxy URLs
- Adds error handling for image loading
- Monitors DOM for dynamic content changes

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms

Multiple fallback layers:
- In-memory image cache
- Local file cache for images
- SVG placeholder generation
- Explicit error handlers with recovery strategies

## Implementation Files

- `server-direct-fix.js`: Minimal proxy server for handling image requests
- `handle-r2-images.js`: Client-side script to fix image URLs
- `public/embed.js`: Embeddable version for third-party sites
- `public/test-fix.html`: Test page to verify the fix works
- `run-minimal-server.sh`: Script to run the minimal server

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run the Full Server

```bash
./start-server.sh
```

This starts the full image proxy server with monitoring and auto-restart.

### Option 2: Run the Minimal Server

```bash
./run-minimal-server.sh
```

This starts only the essential image proxy server for fixing images.

### Testing

1. Start the server
2. Visit http://localhost:3002/test-fix.html
3. Check if all test images load properly

## Integration

To integrate this fix into existing applications:

### Method 1: Add the script tag

```html
<script src="http://localhost:3002/handle-r2-images.js"></script>
```

### Method 2: Use the embeddable version

```html
<script src="http://localhost:3002/embed.js"></script>
```

## Troubleshooting

If images still don't load:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the proxy server is running
3. Check network requests in browser dev tools
4. Try manually calling `window.fixR2Images()` if available

## Maintenance

The local image cache is cleared periodically to prevent disk space issues. The server also includes health monitoring and automatic restart capabilities.
