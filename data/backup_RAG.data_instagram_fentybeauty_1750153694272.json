  "query": "How can I improve my engagement on Instagram?",
  "response": "To boost engagement on Instagram, focus on creating interactive and relatable content.\n\n1.  **Run more Q&A sessions with Rihanna or Fenty Beauty makeup artists.** Use Instagram Stories' Q&A sticker to answer follower questions about product application, skincare routines, or behind-the-scenes insights. This fosters a direct connection and provides valuable content.\n\n2.  **Create interactive polls and quizzes related to beauty trends and product preferences.** Use Instagram Stories' poll and quiz stickers to gather data and spark conversations. This encourages participation and provides valuable insights into your audience's interests.\n\n3.  **Launch a user-generated content (UGC) campaign.** Encourage followers to share their Fenty Beauty looks using a specific hashtag, and then repost the best submissions on your main feed. This builds community and provides authentic content.",
