Limitations:**\n\n*   Based on the available data, I cannot provide specific details about the engagement metrics of individual recent posts. Access to that data would allow for a more precise analysis of content performance.\n*   I do not have access to demographic data about @fentybeauty's followers, which would provide valuable insights for tailoring content to specific audience segments.\n",
