  "query": "How can I grow my engagement in the next month?",
  "response": "Based on the recent post data for @fentybeauty, here's how you might grow engagement in the next month:\n\n*   **Replicate elements from the most engaging post:** The most engaging post, \"Sp'oil your lips like @badgalriri \", achieved 67,131 likes and 437 comments, totaling 67,568 in engagement. This suggests that featuring Rihanna (@badgalriri) significantly boosts engagement. If possible, incorporate similar content.\n\n*   **Focus on \"Born to dew your body right Ô∏è‚Äç\" style content:** This post received 29,447 likes and 141 comments, totaling 29,588 in engagement. This is significantly higher than other recent posts. Consider creating more content centered around body care or similar themes.\n\n*   **Avoid generic captions:** The posts with the caption \"How we‚Äôre showing up to the function: \" received 6,720 likes and 60 comments (totaling 6,780) and 10,228 likes and 99 comments (totaling 10,327) respectively. These performed relatively poorly compared to the \"Born to dew your body right Ô∏è‚Äç\" post. Try to create more unique and engaging captions.\n\n*   **Encourage user-generated content:** The post \"Your camera roll after you sp‚Äôoil your lips ü§≥\" received 3,165 likes and 27 comments, totaling 3,192. While this post performed the worst, the caption suggests user-generated content. Consider running a contest or campaign that encourages users to share their experiences with Fenty Beauty products, as this could increase engagement and brand awareness.\n",
