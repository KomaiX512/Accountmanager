With an average relevance score of only 0.07, the documents may not contain much useful information. Without knowing the document types or any specific data points from the documents (e.g., follower counts, engagement rates, content themes, etc.), I can't provide a detailed analysis of the @maccosmetics Instagram account.\n\nTo give you a more comprehensive analysis, I would need access to data such as:\n\n*   Follower growth trends\n*   Engagement rates (likes, comments, shares, saves)\n*   Content performance (which posts perform best and why)\n*   Hashtag usage and effectiveness\n*   Audience demographics\n*   Competitor analysis\n\nIf you can provide more specific data or access to the relevant documents, I can offer more actionable insights.\n",
