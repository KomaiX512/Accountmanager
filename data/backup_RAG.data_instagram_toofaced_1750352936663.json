Shares are not tracked in this dataset.\n*   **Post Volume:** The account has posted 12 times in the period analyzed.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nI cannot identify the \"most engaging post\" specifically because the provided data lacks individual post performance metrics. I only have access to aggregate averages. To determine the most engaging post, I would need data on likes, comments, and shares for *each* of the 12 recent posts.\n",
