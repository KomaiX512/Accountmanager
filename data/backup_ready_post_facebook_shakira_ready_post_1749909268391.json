    "image_prompt": "A vibrant and energetic image featuring Shakira. The background is a swirling mix of bright, neon colors â€“ fuchsias, oranges, and yellows â€“ creating a dynamic and celebratory atmosphere. Shakira is positioned slightly off-center, striking a powerful and confident pose. She's wearing a bold, eye-catching outfit â€“ perhaps a sequined top and ripped jeans, or a vibrant, flowing dress â€“ something that reflects the energy of the song. Her hair is styled in her signature waves, cascading around her shoulders. The lighting is dramatic, with strong highlights emphasizing her face and outfit. The overall mood is joyful, empowering, and celebratory. Small, stylized musical notes and sound waves float around her, subtly reinforcing the music theme. The image should have a slightly gritty, textured feel, reminiscent of street art or a music video still. The composition should be dynamic and engaging, drawing the viewer's eye directly to Shakira. The style should be modern and edgy, appealing to a broad audience on Facebook."
