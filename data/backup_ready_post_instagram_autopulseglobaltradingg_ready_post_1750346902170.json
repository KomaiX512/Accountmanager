    "image_prompt": "A visually striking and modern graphic design. The background should be a gradient of deep blues and purples, evoking a sense of sophistication and technological advancement. In the center, a stylized brain graphic is composed of interconnected circuits and glowing lines, symbolizing intelligence and strategic thinking. Overlaying the brain, subtle stock market ticker symbols and candlestick charts are faintly visible, hinting at the trading context. The \"autopulseglobaltradingg\" logo is subtly placed in the upper right corner, rendered in a clean, white sans-serif font. The overall mood is futuristic and optimistic. The lighting is soft and diffused, with highlights emphasizing the glowing circuits within the brain graphic. The image should have a high-resolution, polished look, suitable for a professional Instagram feed. The style should be a blend of abstract and realistic elements, creating a visually engaging and informative image. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to the central brain graphic."
