    "image_prompt": "The image should be a visually appealing and slightly abstract representation of a computer screen displaying a colorful test pattern. Imagine a vibrant, high-resolution display with a grid of various colors and shapes. The dominant colors should be a mix of blues, greens, yellows, and reds, arranged in a geometric pattern. The pattern should not be overly complex, but rather clean and modern, resembling a stylized debugging screen.\n\nIn the center of the screen, subtly overlay the \"debugtest\" logo in a semi-transparent white or light grey. The logo should be minimalist and modern, not distracting from the overall color pattern. The lighting should be bright and even, giving the image a clean and professional look. The composition should be slightly angled, as if the viewer is looking at the screen from a slight perspective, adding depth.\n\nThe overall mood should be playful and tech-savvy, hinting at the behind-the-scenes work that goes into ensuring a smooth user experience. Add subtle visual cues like pixelated edges or glitch effects in a very controlled and artistic manner to further emphasize the debugging theme. The image should be high-resolution and optimized for Instagram's display, showcasing clarity and sharpness."
