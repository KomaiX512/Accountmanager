    "image_prompt": "A futuristic, high-resolution digital painting depicting Elon Musk standing on the surface of Mars, looking towards a vibrant, terraformed landscape. The sky is a brilliant blue with wisps of clouds, contrasting with the reddish Martian soil in the foreground. In the middle ground, sleek, modern structures resembling Martian habitats are visible, glowing softly with internal light. A SpaceX Starship is landing gracefully in the distance, kicking up a plume of reddish dust. Elon is wearing a futuristic, silver spacesuit with subtle SpaceX branding. The lighting is dramatic, with the sun casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the Martian landscape. The overall mood is optimistic and inspiring, conveying a sense of progress and human achievement. The style should be reminiscent of concept art for a science fiction film, with a focus on realism and detail. The composition should be balanced, drawing the viewer's eye from Elon to the terraformed landscape and the Starship landing. The color palette should be dominated by blues, reds, and silvers, creating a visually striking and memorable image."
