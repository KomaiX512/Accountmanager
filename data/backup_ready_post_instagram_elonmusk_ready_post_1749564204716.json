    "image_prompt": "The image should be a digital artwork, a hyperrealistic rendering in a vibrant, futuristic style. The central focus is a stylized, glowing brain, partially constructed from circuit boards and rocket components. Wires and miniature Tesla cars should be subtly integrated into the brain's structure. The background is a swirling nebula of deep blues, purples, and electric greens, suggesting infinite possibilities and the vastness of space. The lighting should be dramatic, with the brain emitting a soft, ethereal glow that illuminates the surrounding nebula. The overall mood is optimistic, energetic, and forward-thinking. The composition should be dynamic, with the brain positioned slightly off-center to create a sense of movement and anticipation. Small, holographic projections of various inventions (e.g., a neuralink, a Mars colony, a self-driving car) should float around the brain, hinting at the potential outcomes of future innovation. The style should be reminiscent of digital art found on platforms like ArtStation, with a focus on intricate details and a high level of realism. The color palette should be bold and contrasting, with pops of neon colors against the dark, cosmic background."
