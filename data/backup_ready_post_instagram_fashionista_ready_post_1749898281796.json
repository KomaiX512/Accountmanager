    "image_prompt": "A vibrant and energetic flat lay showcasing key summer fashion trends. The background is a light, textured linen fabric. In the center, a pair of bright pink, chunky platform sandals are the focal point. Surrounding the sandals are several key items: a straw tote bag overflowing with a colorful floral scarf peeking out, a pair of oversized, retro-inspired sunglasses with a tortoiseshell frame, a stack of gold bangles, and a tube of bright red lipstick. To the left, a flowy, midi-length sundress in a bold floral print is partially visible, suggesting movement and lightness. To the right, a denim jacket with embroidered floral details is casually draped. The lighting is bright and airy, creating a summery and cheerful mood. The composition is slightly asymmetrical, with items overlapping to create depth and visual interest. The overall style is playful, trendy, and aspirational, reflecting the \"fashionista\" brand aesthetic. The image should evoke a feeling of excitement and anticipation for summer fashion."
