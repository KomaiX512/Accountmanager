    "image_prompt": "Close-up product shot of the new Fenty Beauty Diamond Bomb All-Over Diamond Veil in \"Cognac Candy\". The product is displayed in its signature compact, showcasing the shimmering bronze shade. The compact is resting on a textured, warm-toned surface, possibly a velvet or suede material in a similar bronze or caramel color. Soft, diffused lighting highlights the reflective particles within the Diamond Bomb, creating a captivating sparkle. The composition is clean and focuses entirely on the product, with a shallow depth of field to blur the background slightly. The overall mood is luxurious, glamorous, and inviting. The shot should be taken from a slightly elevated angle to showcase the texture and dimension of the product. The Fenty Beauty logo is subtly visible on the compact. The image should have a warm, golden color palette with a focus on bronze and caramel tones. The style is high-end beauty photography, emphasizing the product's quality and appeal."
