    "image_prompt": "The image should be a vibrant, eye-catching collage featuring a diverse range of elements representing \"final test.\" The central focus is a stylized, futuristic-looking \"Final Test\" logo in bold, neon colors (electric blue, hot pink, and lime green) against a dark, almost black, background. Surrounding the logo, arrange a series of smaller, interconnected images. These images should include: a close-up of a circuit board with glowing pathways, a stylized brain silhouette filled with abstract patterns, a digital clock displaying \"00:00:00,\" and a magnifying glass hovering over a complex equation. The overall style should be a blend of cyberpunk and minimalist design. Use a shallow depth of field to keep the logo sharp and the surrounding images slightly blurred, creating a sense of depth and focus. Lighting should be dramatic, with strong highlights and shadows to emphasize the neon colors and futuristic feel. The composition should be dynamic and visually engaging, drawing the viewer's eye to the center of the image. Add subtle glitch effects and scanlines to enhance the tech-inspired aesthetic. The mood should be intriguing and slightly mysterious, hinting at the challenges and rewards of a final test."
