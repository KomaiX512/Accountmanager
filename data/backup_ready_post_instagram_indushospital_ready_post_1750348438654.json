    "image_prompt": "The image should be a calming and inviting visual representing mental well-being. Imagine a person sitting peacefully in a sunlit room, perhaps meditating or reading a book. The room should be decorated in soft, pastel colors like light blues, greens, and creams. Natural light streams in through a large window, casting a warm glow on the scene. The person is dressed in comfortable, neutral-toned clothing. Around them are elements that promote relaxation, such as potted plants, a soft blanket draped over a chair, and a steaming mug of tea or herbal infusion on a small side table. The overall mood should be serene and hopeful. The composition should be balanced, with the person as the central focus, surrounded by calming elements. The style should be slightly stylized, with a touch of artistic flair, leaning towards a soft, painterly aesthetic. Consider adding subtle bokeh effects in the background to enhance the dreamy atmosphere. A small Indus Hospital logo can be subtly placed in the corner."
