    "image_prompt": "The image should be a vibrant and playful flat lay on a light blue background. In the center, there's a white smartphone displaying a simple, clean graphic that reads \"Test Post\" in a bold, sans-serif font. Around the phone, scattered playfully, are various colorful office supplies and creative elements. These include: a bright yellow highlighter, a stack of pastel-colored sticky notes, a few paperclips in rose gold, a small succulent in a terracotta pot, and a couple of colorful markers (one teal, one coral). The lighting should be bright and even, creating a cheerful and optimistic mood. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing, with the items arranged in a way that feels both intentional and slightly random. The overall style should be modern, clean, and inviting, reflecting a creative and innovative brand. The image should evoke a sense of experimentation and playfulness."
