    "image_prompt": "The image is a vibrant, eye-catching graphic designed to test color accuracy and clarity on Instagram. The background is a gradient transitioning from a deep teal (#008080) at the top to a bright coral (#FF7F50) at the bottom. Centered on the gradient is a large, stylized \"testfix\" logo in a clean, sans-serif font. The \"test\" portion is a bold, electric blue (#7DF9FF), while the \"fix\" is a sunny yellow (#FFDA63).\n\nOverlapping the logo are several geometric shapes in contrasting colors: a bright pink circle (#FF69B4), a lime green square (#32CD32), and a lavender triangle (#E6E6FA). These shapes should have subtle drop shadows to give them a sense of depth. Scattered around the logo and shapes are small, white stars and sparkles, adding a touch of whimsy.\n\nThe overall mood is playful and energetic. The lighting should be bright and even, showcasing the full range of colors without any harsh shadows or blown-out highlights. The image should be high-resolution and optimized for Instagram's aspect ratio (1:1). The style is modern and minimalist, with a focus on clean lines and bold colors. The composition is balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to the center of the image."
