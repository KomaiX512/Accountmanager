    "image_prompt": "A split-screen image. On the left, a close-up of a computer screen displaying lines of code, primarily in shades of blue, green, and white. The code is blurred slightly to suggest it's complex and technical. A single cursor blinks rhythmically in the middle of the code. The lighting is soft and diffused, emanating from the screen itself. On the right, a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Instagram app. The app shows a post from \"testidentifier\" with the caption \"Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3!\". The background of the phone screen is a clean, minimalist white. The hand holding the phone is slightly blurred to emphasize the screen content. The overall mood is clean, modern, and slightly playful. The composition is balanced, with equal visual weight given to both the code and the Instagram post. The style is a blend of tech and lifestyle, suitable for Instagram. The image should be well-lit and visually appealing, using a shallow depth of field to draw attention to the key elements. A subtle gradient overlay, transitioning from light blue at the top to light grey at the bottom, can enhance the visual appeal."
