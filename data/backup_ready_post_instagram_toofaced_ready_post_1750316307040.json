    "image_prompt": "A close-up, overhead shot of the Too Faced Sweet Peach Palette. The palette is open, showcasing the variety of peach, pink, and bronze eyeshadow shades. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Individual eyeshadow pans should be clearly visible, highlighting the texture and pigment. Scattered around the palette are a few fresh peach slices, adding a natural and playful touch. A single, fluffy makeup brush with peach-colored bristles rests gently on the palette, suggesting application. The background is a soft, creamy peach color, creating a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing composition. The overall mood is bright, cheerful, and feminine. The image should have a slightly blurred background to keep the focus on the palette and peaches. The style should be clean, modern, and high-quality, suitable for a beauty brand's Instagram feed."
