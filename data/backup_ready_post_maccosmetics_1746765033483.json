Image/Video Description:**\n\n*   **Option 1 (Image):** A flat lay or visually appealing arrangement showcasing the new lipstick shades. Include summery elements like sunglasses, sunscreen, or a beach towel to set the scene. Close-ups of the lipstick bullets are a must!\n*   **Option 2 (Video):** A short, engaging video with quick swatches of the new lipstick shades on different skin tones. Use upbeat, summery music and text overlays to highlight the shade names and key features (e.g., long-lasting, hydrating).\n\n**Why this works for M·A·C:**\n\n*   **Tone:** Energetic, playful, and inclusive – aligns with M·A·C's \"All Ages, All Races, All Genders\" philosophy.\n*   **Content:** Focuses on color and trend, which is a M·A·C strength.\n*   **Hashtags:** A mix of broad (e.g., #SummerMakeup) and brand-specific (e.g., #MACLipstick) to maximize reach.\n*   **Engagement:** Asks a question to encourage comments and interaction.\n*   **Visuals:** The suggested image/video options are visually appealing and product-focused, in line with M·A·C's high-quality aesthetic.\n*   **Themes:** The post taps into the summer season, a popular theme for makeup brands.\n\n**Important Reminders (Based on Account Rules):**\n\n*   **Do not include pricing information in the caption.**\n*   **Focus on the benefits and features of the lipsticks, not the cost.**\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to refine it further.\n"
