    "image_prompt": "A dynamic, futuristic cityscape at dusk. The sky is a blend of deep blues, purples, and oranges, with streaks of light suggesting advanced technology. Dominating the foreground is a sleek, silver, almost liquid-metal sculpture resembling a stylized \"X\" logo, reflecting the city lights. Tiny, glowing drones zip between towering, organically shaped skyscrapers. The overall mood is optimistic and forward-thinking. The image should have a slightly blurred, almost dreamlike quality, emphasizing the potential of future technology. The lighting should be dramatic, with strong contrasts between light and shadow. In the lower right corner, subtly include a small, stylized portrait of Elon Musk looking towards the cityscape, almost as if he's observing his creation. The style should be a blend of photorealism and digital art, making it visually striking and shareable on X. The composition should be wide-angle, capturing the vastness and potential of the future."
