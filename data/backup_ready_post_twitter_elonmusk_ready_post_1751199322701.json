    "image_prompt": "A stark, high-contrast black and white image. The composition is a close-up of a cracked, antique mirror reflecting a blurred cityscape at night. The cracks in the mirror are sharply defined, creating a sense of distortion and fragmentation. The cityscape lights are visible as indistinct streaks and points of light, suggesting technological advancement but also chaos. The overall mood is unsettling and thought-provoking. The image is desaturated, emphasizing the contrast between light and shadow. The style is reminiscent of film noir, with a focus on dramatic lighting and visual metaphors. The reflection is slightly out of focus, adding to the sense of unease and highlighting the fragility of the reflected image. The image aims to convey the idea that free speech, while sometimes messy and distorted, is essential for reflecting reality and driving innovation."
