    "image_prompt": "The image is a split-screen composition. On the left, a brightly lit, modern university library with students studying at tables, bathed in warm, inviting light. The color palette is dominated by warm wood tones, soft blues, and greens, creating a studious and optimistic atmosphere. On the right, a starkly contrasting image: a dimly lit, almost dystopian scene of a crumbling lecture hall, with peeling paint and empty seats. The color palette here is muted and desaturated, with grays, browns, and hints of faded blues. A single, flickering fluorescent light casts long, ominous shadows. The overall mood is one of decay and uncertainty. The split emphasizes the contrast between the idealized image of higher education and a more pessimistic view of its future. A subtle, stylized graphic of the ChatGPT logo is overlaid on the library side, subtly linking the free access to a potential alternative to traditional education. The image aims to be thought-provoking and visually arresting, prompting viewers to consider the future of education."
