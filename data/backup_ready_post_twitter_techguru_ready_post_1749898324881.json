    "image_prompt": "A brightly lit, eye-level close-up shot of a person's hands holding a smartphone. The background is a clean, modern workspace with a blurred laptop, a stylish coffee mug, and a small succulent plant. The smartphone screen displays a visually appealing productivity app interface, possibly a task management app with colorful icons and a clean layout. The person's fingers are subtly interacting with the screen, perhaps checking off a task. The overall mood is calm, focused, and efficient. The color palette is primarily white, light gray, and pastel blues and greens, creating a sense of serenity and organization. The lighting is soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows. The image should convey a feeling of control and accomplishment. The style should be modern and minimalist, appealing to a tech-savvy audience. Consider adding subtle visual elements like a faint glow emanating from the smartphone screen or a slight depth of field to draw attention to the app interface. The composition should be balanced and visually pleasing, with the smartphone as the central focal point. The image should feel authentic and relatable, avoiding overly staged or artificial elements."
