Based on your recent posts and IGTV videos, here's a breakdown and some suggestions:\n\n**What I see you're doing well:**\n\n*   **Product-focused content:** Your recent posts and IGTV videos heavily feature specific products, showcasing their application and benefits (e.g., Light Reflecting Luminizing Powder, Afterglow Lip Shine, Summer Unrated palettes).\n*   **Visual Appeal:** Your content is visually appealing, with high-quality videos and images.\n*   **Tutorials & How-Tos:** You include application tips and techniques in your captions and videos, which is helpful for your audience.\n*   **Collaboration:** You tag makeup artists and influencers in your posts.\n\n**Opportunities to Enhance Product Promotion:**\n\n*   **Direct Call to Action:** While you mention availability, consider adding stronger calls to action in *every* product-focused post. Examples:\n    *   \"Shop now via the link in our bio!\"\n    *   \"What's your favorite shade? Tell us in the comments and shop now at [Retailer]!\"\n    *   \"Tap to shop this look!\" (using Instagram Shopping tags)\n*   **Instagram Shopping:** You are a business account, so make sure you've fully set up Instagram Shopping. Tag products directly in your posts and stories to make purchasing seamless.\n*   **User-Generated Content:** Encourage customers to share their looks using your products with a dedicated hashtag (e.g., #NARSissistLook). Repost this content to showcase real users and build social proof.\n*   **Behind-the-Scenes:** Show the product development process, inspiration, or the \"making of\" a campaign. This can create a deeper connection with your audience.\n*   **Limited-Edition Focus:** You highlight limited-edition collections. Create a sense of urgency by emphasizing the limited availability and potential for products to sell out.\n*   **Highlight Reels:** Create dedicated Highlight Reels for key product categories (e.g., \"Lip Products,\" \"Face,\" \"Eyes\"). This makes it easy for users to find information about specific products.\n*   **Engage with Comments:** Respond to questions about products in the comments section to provide excellent customer service and encourage purchases.\n*   **Influencer Marketing:** Continue to collaborate with makeup artists and influencers, but ensure they are *clearly* showcasing and reviewing your products. Consider gifting programs or sponsored content.\n*   **Product Bundles:** Promote product bundles or sets to encourage customers to purchase multiple items.\n\n**Specific to your recent posts:**\n\n*   **\"Covered in chocolate\" post:** Great visual! Consider asking followers what their favorite chocolate-inspired lip combo is.\n*   **\"Shades made to shine\" post:** The carousel is good. In the caption, ask followers which shade is their favorite and why.\n*   **\"Sealed with a swipe of shine\" post:** Good to tag the photographer. Ask followers which shade they'd choose for a night out.\n*   **\"Evolve. Everywhere\" post:** Good video. Ask followers where they'd take this collection on vacation.\n*   **\"Lip on the go\" post:** Great to tag the influencer. Ask followers what their go-to lip combo is for a quick touch-up.\n*   **\"Swipe however you like\" post:** Good video. Ask followers which shade they'd wear for a first date.\n*   **\"Up your gloss game\" post:** Good product descriptions. Ask followers which shade they're most excited to try.\n*   **\"Fun fact\" post:** Good to tag the artist. Ask followers if they've tried layering blush and highlighter.\n*   **\"Choose your sheen\" post:** Good to mention availability at Ulta. Ask followers which shade they'd wear for a special occasion.\n*   **\"Evolve. Everywhere\" post:** Good video. Ask followers where they'd take this collection on vacation.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can create a more engaging and effective Instagram presence that drives product awareness and sales.\n"
