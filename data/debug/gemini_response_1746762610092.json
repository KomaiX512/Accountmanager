            "text": "Okay, here's the breakdown of your follower/following situation on Instagram:\n\n*   **Followers:** 23,996,598\n*   **Following:** 1,350\n\n**What this means and actionable insights:**\n\n*   **High Follower Count:** You have a massive following, indicating strong brand recognition and influence in the cosmetics industry.\n*   **Low Following Count:** Your significantly lower following count suggests a strategic approach to who you follow. This is typical for large brands.\n\n**Actionable Advice:**\n\n1.  **Maintain a High Standard for Accounts You Follow:** Given your low following count, ensure that the accounts you follow are highly relevant to your brand, such as key makeup artists (e.g., Nikki_Makeup, James Molloy Makeup Artist, Sofia Tilbury), influential beauty brands (e.g., Rare Beauty, FENTY SKIN, ONE/SIZE, Dior Beauty Lovers), or major fashion publications (e.g., Vogue, Cosmopolitan).\n2.  **Monitor Engagement with Followed Accounts:** Track how your engagement (likes, comments) with the accounts you follow impacts your brand's visibility and reach.\n3.  **Strategic Following for Collaborations:** Consider following accounts of potential collaboration partners (e.g., celebrities like Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, or other beauty brands) a few weeks before reaching out for a collaboration to signal interest.\n4.  **Follow Regional MAC Accounts:** You already do this, but continue to follow and engage with your regional MAC Cosmetics accounts (e.g., M·A·C Cosmetics Canada, M·A·C Cosmetics Italia Market, M·A·C Cosmetics México Market, M·A·C Cosmetics India Market) to support and amplify their content.\n5.  **Don't get tempted to follow everyone back:** With such a large following, a follow-back strategy isn't scalable or strategic. Focus on quality over quantity in your following list.\n"
