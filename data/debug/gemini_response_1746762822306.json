Leverage this more! The Met Gala content featuring Romero Jennings and highlighting M·A·C's influence through the decades is a great example. Consider more \"history of M·A·C\" posts, highlighting iconic products and campaigns.\n2.  **Reels Focus:** Many competitors (especially SHEGLAM) are crushing it with Reels. Increase your frequency and experiment with trending sounds and challenges.\n3.  **Service Promotion:** You're promoting in-store services like \"Party at M·A·C.\" Make these more visually appealing and highlight the \"group glam\" aspect to attract friend groups.\n4.  **\"Tag Yourself\" Engagement:** The \"Tag yourself\" post performed very well. Create more relatable content that encourages users to tag friends and share.\n5.  **Highlight Inclusivity:** M·A·C's bio states \"All Ages, All Races, All Genders.\" Ensure your content consistently reflects this. Feature diverse models and makeup looks.\n6.  **Product-Focused Tutorials:** While you do some tutorials, focus on *specific* products and how to use them. The \"How to MAC Stack\" video is a good example.\n7.  **Monitor Competitor Performance:** Regularly analyze the engagement (likes, comments, shares, saves) on your competitors' posts to identify what's working for them.\n\nBy closely monitoring these competitors and implementing these strategies, you can refine your Instagram approach and strengthen M·A·C's position in the market.\n"
