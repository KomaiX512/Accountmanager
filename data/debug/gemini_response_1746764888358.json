            "text": "Okay, here's an Instagram post draft for M·A·C Cosmetics, focusing on new lipstick shades for summer, based on your profile data and account rules:\n\n**1. Caption:**\n\n\"☀️ Pucker up, Buttercups! ☀️ Get ready to turn up the heat this summer with our NEW lipstick shades! 💋 We're talking vibrant corals, juicy berries, and sun-kissed nudes that are guaranteed to make you feel like you're on vacation, even if you're just hitting the city streets. 😉 Which shade will be your summer fling? Tell us in the comments! 👇\"\n\n**2. Hashtags:**\n\n*   #MACLipstick\n*   #SummerMakeup\n*   #NewShades\n*   #LipstickObsessed\n*   #MACNudes\n*   #SummerVibes\n*   #MakeupLover\n*   #MACAddict\n\n**3. Image/Video Description:**\n\n*   **Option 1 (Video):** A short, upbeat video showcasing the new lipstick shades. The video could feature diverse models applying the lipsticks, close-ups of the colors, and quick cuts of summery scenes (beach, pool, city rooftop). Use trendy music!\n*   **Option 2 (Image Carousel):** A carousel post with high-quality images of the new lipstick shades. Each slide could feature a different shade, with a model wearing it and a product shot. Consider using bright, summery backgrounds and props.\n\n**Why this works for M·A·C:**\n\n*   **Tone:** The caption is playful and inviting, aligning with M·A·C's generally fun and inclusive brand voice.\n*   **Product Focus:** It directly highlights the new lipstick shades, which is the goal of your request.\n*   **Engagement:** The question at the end encourages followers to comment and share their preferences.\n*   **Hashtags:** The hashtags are a mix of general makeup terms and M·A·C-specific tags, increasing visibility.\n*   **Visuals:** The image/video descriptions suggest content that is visually appealing and on-trend, which is crucial for Instagram success.\n*   **Met Gala Connection:** Since the Met Gala is a recent theme, you could subtly tie in the \"Tailored for You\" concept by mentioning that these shades are perfect for creating a customized summer look.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like any revisions.\n"
