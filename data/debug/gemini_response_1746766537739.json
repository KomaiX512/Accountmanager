            "text": "Okay, based on M·A·C Cosmetics' Instagram activity, here's a surprising next post idea, playing on current trends and M·A·C's strengths:\n\n**Concept: A \"Get Ready With Me\" (GRWM) video, but with a twist:**\n\n*   **Surprise Element:** Feature a *male* makeup artist transforming a *male* model using only M·A·C products.\n*   **Why this is surprising (and effective):**\n    *   **Breaks Expectations:** While M·A·C champions \"All Ages, All Races, All Genders,\" their content often leans towards female-presenting models.
