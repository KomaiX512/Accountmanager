The palette is sleek and rectangular, with a matte black finish and the MAC logo subtly embossed in the corner. Inside, the eyeshadows are arranged in a grid, showcasing a range of warm, earthy tones: deep browns, burnt oranges, golden yellows, and muted greens. The eyeshadows have a mix of matte, shimmer, and satin finishes.\n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting mood. A few scattered autumn leaves in varying shades of red, orange, and brown are artfully placed around the palette, adding a touch of seasonal flair. A single makeup brush, preferably a blending brush with soft, natural bristles, rests gently on the edge of the palette, suggesting ease of use and application. The background is a textured, warm-toned surface, like a wooden table or a piece of linen fabric, to enhance the earthy aesthetic. The overall composition is clean, modern, and visually appealing, highlighting the palette's beautiful colors and textures. The image should evoke feelings of warmth, comfort, and autumnal beauty. The style should be high-quality, professional, and consistent with MAC Cosmetics' brand aesthetic.\n"
