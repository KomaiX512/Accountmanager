Which shade are you adding to your beach bag? üíã\n\nHashtags: #MACSummer #MACLipstick #SummerMakeup #NewMakeup #LipstickLover #MACCosmetics #SummerVibes #MakeupObsessed #LimitedEdition #Beauty\n\nCall to Action: Tap to shop the collection and find your perfect summer shade!\n\nVisual Description for Image: A vibrant, eye-catching flat lay showcasing the new MAC summer lipstick shades. The background is a bright, textured white surface, possibly linen or a slightly distressed wooden board, to give a summery, natural feel. Arranged artfully on the surface are five lipsticks in the new shades: a vibrant coral, a juicy watermelon pink, a shimmering bronze, a bright tangerine orange, and a cool berry shade. Each lipstick tube is partially open, revealing the bullet of color.\n\nScattered around the lipsticks are small, summery props: a few scattered seashells, a pair of stylish sunglasses with mirrored lenses reflecting the sky, a sprig of fresh mint, and a few slices of fresh fruit corresponding to the lipstick shades (e.g., a slice of watermelon near the pink lipstick, a slice of orange near the tangerine lipstick). The lighting is bright and natural, mimicking direct sunlight, with soft shadows adding depth and dimension. The overall mood is playful, vibrant, and inviting, capturing the essence of summer. The composition is balanced and visually appealing, with the lipsticks as the clear focal point. The style is clean, modern, and aspirational, reflecting the MAC brand aesthetic. The image should evoke feelings of warmth, fun, and effortless beauty.\n"
