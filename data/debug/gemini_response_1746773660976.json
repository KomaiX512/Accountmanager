The model should have flawless skin with a subtle highlight on the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, and cupid's bow. The eyeshadow should be a soft, shimmering rose gold, blended seamlessly into the crease. The lips should be glossy and nude, with a hint of pink. The background should be blurred and out of focus, with soft, warm lighting creating a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere. The focus should be sharp on the model's eyes, which should be captivating and expressive. The overall mood should be sophisticated, glamorous, and aspirational. The image should have a high-quality, professional feel, with attention to detail in every aspect of the makeup and lighting. The model should be wearing a simple, elegant top in a neutral color to avoid distracting from the makeup. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing, with the model's face centered in the frame. The style should be modern and chic, reflecting the MAC Cosmetics brand aesthetic. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a flattering and luminous effect. A few stray strands of hair should be artfully placed around the face to add a touch of effortless beauty.\n"
