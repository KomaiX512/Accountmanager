The background is a light, summery pastel pink, creating a soft and inviting atmosphere. Scattered across the background are a few faux tropical leaves in varying shades of green, adding a touch of summer freshness.\n\nThe lipsticks themselves are arranged in a visually appealing manner, perhaps in a slightly scattered, yet organized fashion. The collection features a range of shades, from bright corals and hot pinks to warm nudes and shimmering golds. Each lipstick tube should be clearly visible, showcasing the MAC logo and the shade name.\n\nA few loose, iridescent glitter particles are sprinkled around the lipsticks, catching the light and adding a touch of glamour. A single, perfectly ripe strawberry is placed near the lipsticks, further emphasizing the summer theme and adding a pop of natural red.\n\nThe lighting should be bright and even, highlighting the colors and textures of the lipsticks and the surrounding elements. The overall mood is playful, vibrant, and luxurious, capturing the essence of summer beauty. The image should be high-resolution and professionally styled, reflecting the quality and prestige of the MAC Cosmetics brand. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to the lipsticks and the overall summer theme.\n"
