The model has flawless, dewy skin with a subtle, natural makeup look. The lipstick is a bold, classic red with a creamy, satin finish. The lips are slightly parted, suggesting a playful, confident expression. The background is blurred and out of focus, a soft gradient of warm, neutral tones. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a flattering and inviting atmosphere. The image should be styled in a modern, editorial fashion, with a focus on showcasing the texture and color payoff of the lipstick. The composition is tight, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the lips. There should be a subtle glisten on the lips, suggesting a hydrating formula. The overall mood is luxurious, glamorous, and aspirational. The image should evoke a feeling of confidence and empowerment. The model should have a diverse skin tone, representing MAC's commitment to inclusivity. The image should be suitable for both Instagram feed and story formats.\n"
