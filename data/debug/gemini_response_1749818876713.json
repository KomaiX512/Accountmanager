She should be centered, wearing a shimmering, iridescent outfit that catches the light. The background is a kaleidoscope of colors, blending neon pinks, electric blues, and sunny yellows. Imagine a digital art style, almost like a moving painting, with abstract shapes and patterns swirling around her. Her hair is flowing and voluminous, catching the light and adding to the sense of movement. The lighting is bright and bold, creating a sense of excitement and anticipation. The overall mood is playful, creative, and slightly surreal. The image should evoke a sense of innovation and artistic exploration. The composition should be slightly tilted, adding to the dynamic feel. Think of a modern, digital interpretation of a classic pop art style, with a futuristic twist. The image should be high-resolution and visually striking, designed to grab attention on a Facebook feed.\n"
