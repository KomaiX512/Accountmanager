Focus on influencers who genuinely use and love Fenty Beauty products.\n    *   **Cross-Promotions with Complementary Brands:**  Explore collaborations with brands that align with Fenty Beauty's values and target audience but aren't direct competitors.  Examples:  Skincare brands (that complement makeup), fashion brands, or even lifestyle brands that promote self-expression and inclusivity.\n    *   **Content Creator Program:** Establish a formal program where creators can apply to receive products and create content in exchange for promotion.
