            "text": "Okay, let's brainstorm some content ideas and growth tips for your Instagram profile, `test_instagram_user`, assuming it has a growing audience. To give you the *best* advice, I need a little more information about your profile.  However, I'll provide general advice that can be adapted to most niches.\n\n**Before we dive in, consider these questions:**\n\n*   **What is your niche/topic?** (e.g., travel, fitness, cooking, art, business, humor, etc.)\n*   **Who is your target audience?** (Age, interests, location, etc.)\n*   **What are your goals for Instagram?** (Brand awareness, lead generation, sales, community building, etc.)\n*   **What kind of content have you posted in the past, and what has performed well?** (Look at your Insights!)\n\n**Content Ideas (General, Adaptable to Your Niche):**\n\n1.  **Behind-the-Scenes Content:**\n    *   **Idea:** Show the process behind your work, a day in your life, or a sneak peek at upcoming projects.\n    *   **Why it works:** Builds authenticity and connection with your audience.
