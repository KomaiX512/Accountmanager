The background is a clean, white wooden surface. In the center is a minimalist white desk with a partially open laptop displaying a clean, modern to-do list app. To the left of the laptop is a steaming mug of coffee in a pastel pink ceramic mug. Next to the mug is a small succulent in a geometric concrete pot. To the right of the laptop, there's a stylish planner open to a weekly spread, with a pen resting on top. The planner should have a soft, muted color palette (think blush pinks, light grays, and creams). Scattered around the desk are a few small, aesthetically pleasing items: a pair of wireless headphones in a rose gold color, a small stack of books tied with twine, and a pair of stylish glasses. The lighting is soft and natural, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The overall mood is calm, organized, and inspiring. The image should evoke a sense of peaceful productivity and a desire to start the day off right. The style is clean, modern, and minimalist, appealing to a young, aspirational audience.\n"
