What's your go-to healthy breakfast? Let us know in the comments! üëá\n\nHashtags: #HealthyBreakfast #BreakfastRecipes #HealthyEating #FoodLover #MorningMotivation\n\nCall to Action: Share your favorite healthy breakfast recipe in the comments below!\n\nVisual Description for Image: A bright and airy flat lay featuring three different healthy breakfast options. In the top left corner, a vibrant pink smoothie bowl topped with fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), chia seeds, shredded coconut, and a drizzle of honey. The bowl is ceramic, light pink, and slightly textured. In the center, overnight oats in a clear glass jar, layered with rolled oats, almond milk, chia seeds, sliced bananas, and chopped walnuts. A spoon rests against the jar. In the bottom right corner, a slice of whole-wheat toast topped with avocado, a fried egg (yolk runny), and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. The toast sits on a small wooden cutting board. The background is a clean, white marble surface. Natural light streams in from the top left, creating soft shadows. Scattered around the breakfast items are a few sprigs of fresh mint and a small bowl of mixed nuts. The overall mood is fresh, inviting, and healthy. The image should be high-resolution and visually appealing, suitable for a food-focused Facebook page. The style should be modern and slightly minimalist, emphasizing the natural colors and textures of the food.\n"
