Audience Engagement Techniques: Interactive Q&A Sessions & Personalized Recommendations**\n\n*   **Problem:** While Fenty Beauty has a large following, there's room to foster deeper, more personalized interactions.\n*   **Solution:**\n    *   **\"Ask Rihanna\" Live Q&A:** Host regular live Q&A sessions with Rihanna, focusing on beauty tips, product recommendations, and personal insights. Promote these sessions heavily in advance.\n    *   **Personalized Product Recommendations:** Utilize Instagram Stories' quiz and poll features to create interactive product recommendation tools.

Platform-Specific Growth Tactics: Leverage Instagram Reels & Collaborations**\n\n*   **Problem:** While Fenty Beauty likely uses Reels, there's an opportunity to optimize their strategy for maximum reach and engagement.\n*   **Solution:**\n    *   **Trend-Driven Reels:** Create short, engaging Reels that capitalize on trending audio and visual formats. Focus on quick tutorials, product demonstrations, and behind-the-scenes glimpses.\n    *   **Micro-Influencer Collaborations:** Partner with micro-influencers (10k-50k followers) who have a strong connection with their audience and align with Fenty Beauty's values.
