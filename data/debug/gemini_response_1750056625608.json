However, maintaining and growing engagement within such a large audience requires a strategic and consistent approach. This consultation focuses on optimizing content, fostering deeper audience connections, and leveraging Instagram's unique features to further expand reach and impact.\n\n**Current Account Overview (Based on Publicly Available Information):**\n\n*   **Follower Count:** 23,949,264 (Significant reach and brand awareness)\n*   **Industry:** Cosmetics, Beauty\n*   **Likely Content Pillars:** Product showcases, makeup tutorials, artist collaborations, behind-the-scenes glimpses, user-generated content (UGC), promotional campaigns, inclusivity and diversity representation.\n*   **Potential Strengths:** Strong brand recognition, visually appealing content, established influencer network.\n*   **Potential Areas for Improvement:** Deeper audience engagement, leveraging newer Instagram features, data-driven content optimization.\n\n**Marketing Recommendations:**\n\nHere are three specific, actionable recommendations to grow engagement and reach on Instagram:\n\n**1.
