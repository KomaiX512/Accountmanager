The background is a soft, warm beige color, mimicking sand. The main focus is a selection of bronzing powders in various shades, arranged artfully. One bronzer compact is open, revealing a beautiful, swirling pattern of bronze and gold shimmer. A fluffy, angled bronzer brush rests gently on top of the open compact, lightly dusted with product. Next to the bronzers, there's a tube of MAC's bronzing primer, partially visible. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. Small seashells and starfish are scattered subtly around the products, adding a beachy, summery vibe. The overall aesthetic is luxurious, natural, and aspirational. The image should have a shallow depth of field, blurring the background slightly to keep the focus on the bronzing products. The style is clean, modern, and high-end, consistent with the MAC brand. The image should evoke feelings of warmth, sunshine, and effortless beauty.\n"
