Repost the best submissions to your feed and stories to build community and social proof.\n\n2.  **Leverage Instagram Reels for tutorials:** Create short, engaging Reels showcasing product application techniques and makeup looks. Use trending audio and collaborate with beauty influencers to expand reach and drive product discovery.\n\n3.  **Optimize Instagram Shop:** Tag all products featured in posts and stories with shoppable links. Regularly update your Shop with new arrivals and promotions to make it easy for followers to purchase directly from Instagram.\n"
