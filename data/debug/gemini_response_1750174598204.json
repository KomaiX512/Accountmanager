The palette should be open, showcasing a range of highly pigmented, jewel-toned eyeshadows (think emerald green, sapphire blue, ruby red, amethyst purple, and gold). The artist's hand should be manicured with a glossy, nude nail polish. A makeup brush with soft, synthetic bristles is poised just above the palette, ready to pick up color. Soft, diffused studio lighting should illuminate the palette, highlighting the texture and shimmer of the eyeshadows. The background should be blurred, creating a shallow depth of field and focusing attention on the palette and brush. The overall mood should be playful, creative, and inspiring. The composition should be slightly angled, creating a dynamic and visually interesting shot. The style should be clean and modern, reflecting the MAC brand aesthetic. A subtle, artistic blur effect can be added to the edges of the image to further enhance the focus on the central elements. The image should evoke a sense of excitement and anticipation for creating a stunning makeup look.\n"
