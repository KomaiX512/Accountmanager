Stay tuned, besties, because you're not gonna want to miss this! üî•\n\nHashtags: #FentyBeauty #FentyFam #MakeupMagic #BeautyCollab #ArmanWali #NewDrop #ComingSoon #BeautyCommunity #MakeupLover #Rihanna\n\nCall to Action: Tell us in the comments what kind of Fenty Beauty product you're hoping for next! üëá\n\nVisual Description for Image: A vibrant, high-energy studio shot featuring Rihanna and @armanwali. Rihanna is positioned slightly to the left, radiating confidence in a bold, graphic eyeliner look and a glossy nude lip. She's wearing a sleek, futuristic silver top. @armanwali stands to her right, smiling warmly and wearing a cool, streetwear-inspired outfit with pops of neon green. The background is a gradient of electric purple and hot pink, with abstract geometric shapes floating around them, creating a dynamic and modern vibe. Lighting is bright and diffused, with subtle rim lighting highlighting their features. The overall mood is playful, collaborative, and exciting. In the foreground, scattered makeup brushes and Fenty Beauty products (like Killawatt Freestyle Highlighters and Gloss Bomb) are artfully arranged, adding a touch of glamour and hinting at the creative process. The image should feel aspirational yet accessible, embodying the inclusive and innovative spirit of Fenty Beauty. The composition should be balanced, with a focus on capturing the genuine connection between Rihanna and @armanwali.\n"
