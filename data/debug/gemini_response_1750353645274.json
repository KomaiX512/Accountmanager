Therefore, I cannot identify the *most* engaging post based on content. I can only speak to the *average* engagement across the 12 most recent posts analyzed.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nTo improve engagement, Too Faced should consider strategies to increase likes and comments. Given the low engagement rate, a review of content strategy is recommended.\n"
