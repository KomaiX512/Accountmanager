However, the engagement rate decreased by 5%. This suggests that while the account is attracting new followers, the content may not be resonating with them as much as before.  Recommendation: Analyze the top-performing posts from the previous month and identify common themes or formats.  Experiment with different content types and calls to action to see what drives higher engagement.\"\n\n**In summary, please provide the data, and I will provide a comprehensive and actionable business analysis for your Instagram account.**\n"
