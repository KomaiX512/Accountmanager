The focus is on the eyes, which feature a gradient of peach and coral shades, blended seamlessly with a touch of shimmering gold in the inner corner. The skin is dewy and radiant, with a subtle peach blush on the cheeks. Lips are glossy and nude-pink. The background is a soft, diffused pink, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the texture and colors of the makeup. The woman's expression is confident and playful, with a slight smile. Her hair is styled in loose waves, framing her face. The overall aesthetic is youthful, feminine, and effortlessly chic. The Sweet Peach Palette is subtly visible in the corner of the frame, adding a touch of brand recognition without being overly promotional. The image should evoke a feeling of joy, creativity, and self-expression. The style should be clean, modern, and high-quality, consistent with Too Faced's brand aesthetic.\n"
