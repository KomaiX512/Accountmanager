What are you building with it? ðŸ¤” (I still think higher ed is closer to collapse than we think...)\n\nHashtags:\n#ChatGPT #AI #College\n\nCall to Action:\nReply with your coolest ChatGPT project!\n\nVisual Description for Image:\nThe image is a split-screen composition. On the left, a brightly lit, modern university library with students studying at tables, bathed in warm, inviting light. The color palette is dominated by warm wood tones, soft blues, and greens, creating a studious and optimistic atmosphere. On the right, a starkly contrasting image: a dimly lit, almost dystopian scene of a crumbling lecture hall, with peeling paint and empty seats. The color palette here is muted and desaturated, with grays, browns, and hints of faded blues. A single, flickering fluorescent light casts long, ominous shadows. The overall mood is one of decay and uncertainty. The split emphasizes the contrast between the idealized image of higher education and a more pessimistic view of its future. A subtle, stylized graphic of the ChatGPT logo is overlaid on the library side, subtly linking the free access to a potential alternative to traditional education. The image aims to be thought-provoking and visually arresting, prompting viewers to consider the future of education.\n"
