            "text": "Caption:\nOkay, okay, *maybe* we underestimated Sora a *little*. Video gen is wild. But seriously, folks, let's try to keep the servers (and our team) from melting down, yeah? ðŸ˜…\n\nHashtags:\n#Sora #VideoGeneration #AI\n\nCall to Action:\nShow us your *best* (and most reasonable!) Sora creations below! ðŸ‘‡\n\nVisual Description for Image:\nThe image is a slightly tongue-in-cheek, digitally rendered scene depicting a server room on fire. The overall color palette is dominated by oranges, reds, and yellows, creating a sense of intense heat and chaos. Several servers are visibly melting, with sparks flying and smoke billowing upwards. In the foreground, a cartoonish depiction of the @sama team is shown running away in various states of panic and exhaustion. One team member is comically holding a fire extinguisher pointed in the wrong direction. The style is reminiscent of a simplified, slightly exaggerated animation, similar to a meme format. The background features a blurred, out-of-focus representation of more servers, emphasizing the scale of the server farm. The mood is humorous and self-deprecating, acknowledging the overwhelming demand for the video generation model while also highlighting the strain it places on resources and personnel. The image aims to be relatable and lighthearted, using visual humor to convey the message.\n"
