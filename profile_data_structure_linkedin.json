                "postText": "I often find myself giving [mostly solicited] advice to students and friends on how to make a good CV. For easy referencing, just thought of collecting the most critical pointers here, under the title:\n\n\"[Probably the Shortest] Workshop on Preparing a Good CV and Preparing Yourself for a Good CV\"\n\nSo here goes:\n\nA. Attractive by Design!\n\n1. The document should appeal to the eyes without turning into an infographic.\n\n2. Most relevant information the employer may want to look at should be the easiest to spot.\n\n3. [Unless really forced to] Don't feel bound to any length or title. E.g., you could have a mix of a cover letter and brief CV as one document, and a full CV as another. And by all means, make a long CV, as long as you provide an executive summary.\n\nB. Savoury Bits!\n\n1. Good design will get you a first glance, but to really captivate the evaluator you will need to show true passion and calibre - hence the second part of the workshop \"Preparing Yourself for a Good CV\".\n\n2. Good organisations prefer people who are reflective, self-aware, passionate, and show clarity of purpose. Make sure you cultivate these in yourself over time as it will then become easier to write a truly meaningful statement about yourself and your purpose (making it the strongest point of your CV).\n\n3. Smart employers look for evidence. You say you have passion for xyz? Great, do you have something to show for it on your CV? Where's your passion project (link, repository, channel, article, prototype)? You say you are good at this or that? Where's the marked achievement (award, funding, trophy, medal, publication)?\n\n4. Excellent employers look for legacy. It's not enough to say what experience your previous jobs, community, or university gave you. What did you give them? Founded a new club at college? Introduced diversity training at work? Developed more efficient ways-of-working with the team? Extensively expanded the client base?\n\n5. Narrative matters. See if you can connect various sections with a narrative without turning the CV into a novel. The best connecting narrative would be your claimed purpose and passion. \n\n6. Finally, don't forget the human touch. What makes you interesting?\n\nPop Quiz: Try to find some of these elements in the attached sample.\n\nPS:\n- The list above is neither exhaustive nor universal. Many ways to reach the same goal.\n- I personally prefer to send a brief CV which kind of also serves as a cover letter (as in this post) and a full CV (20 pages, listing all the projects, publications, supervised theses etc. with sufficient detail). Depending on the job, your field, and your experience, a separate full CV may not even be needed.",

Raised in Dubai, Haya understood 𝗨𝗿𝗱𝘂, but never formally learned it. That changed at Habib, where a 𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘂𝗺 course sparked her journey from hesitant reader to language innovator.\n\nHer final-year thesis project, 𝗗𝗶𝗯𝗶: 𝗛𝘂𝗿𝘂𝗳 𝗔𝗯𝗮𝗱 𝗘𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, is a play-based Urdu learning console for children aged 5–9. With tactile controls, joyful visuals, and culturally rooted games, Dibi turns screen time into hands-on language learning.\n\nAt Habib University, students like Haya are empowered to transform personal experiences into 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲, 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 that contribute meaningfully to society.\n\nLearn more about Dibi and Haya’s journey as penned by her, here: https://lnkd.in/dqVxqN5v \n\n#HabibUniversity #StudentInnovation #DibiProject #UrduLearning #ThesisToImpact #ShapingFutures",
