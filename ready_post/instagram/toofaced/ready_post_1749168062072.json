    "image_prompt": "The image should be a close-up shot of a person's face showcasing a vibrant and artistic makeup look using Too Faced products. The background should be a soft, blurred gradient of pastel colors like lavender, baby pink, and sky blue, creating a dreamy and ethereal atmosphere. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the details of the makeup without harsh shadows.\n\nThe makeup itself should be bold and colorful, featuring a mix of eyeshadows, eyeliners, and lip colors from Too Faced. Think graphic eyeliner in bright neon shades, blended eyeshadows in contrasting colors like pink and green, and a glossy lip in a vibrant berry tone. The skin should have a dewy, radiant finish, achieved with Too Faced foundation and highlighter.\n\nThe overall style should be playful and whimsical, with a touch of glamour. The model should have a confident and expressive gaze, conveying a sense of creativity and self-assurance. Consider adding small, artistic details like glitter accents or strategically placed gems to enhance the overall look. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to the intricate details of the makeup. The image should evoke a feeling of joy, creativity, and self-expression."
