    "image_prompt": "A close-up, overhead shot of the MAC Cosmetics Summer Eyeshadow Collection palette. The palette itself is a sleek, limited-edition design with a pearlescent white finish and subtle gold accents. The eyeshadows are arranged in a grid, showcasing a range of warm, summery shades. Colors include shimmering golds, bronzes, vibrant corals, turquoise blues, and a deep, matte brown for definition. The eyeshadows are highly pigmented and appear smooth and creamy.\n\nScattered around the palette are a few key makeup tools: a MAC 217 Blending Brush with a light dusting of eyeshadow on the bristles, a small MAC eyeshadow pot with a single, vibrant coral shade, and a MAC Prep + Prime Fix+ bottle subtly blurred in the background to suggest a dewy, fresh look.\n\nThe lighting is bright and natural, mimicking sunlight, with soft shadows that highlight the texture of the eyeshadows and the details of the packaging. The overall mood is playful, vibrant, and luxurious, evoking a sense of summer fun and effortless beauty. The composition is clean and modern, with a focus on showcasing the colors and textures of the eyeshadows. The background is a soft, blurred gradient of pastel pink and peach, further enhancing the summery vibe. The image should feel high-quality and aspirational, reflecting the MAC Cosmetics brand aesthetic."
