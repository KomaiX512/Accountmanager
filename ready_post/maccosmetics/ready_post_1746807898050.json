    "image_prompt": "A close-up, vibrant, and luxurious shot showcasing a selection of MAC lipsticks. The background is a soft, blurred gradient of pink and gold, creating a dreamy and high-end feel. In the foreground, arrange five different MAC lipstick tubes in a semi-circle, fanned out slightly. The lipstick shades should range from a classic red to a bold berry, a nude, a vibrant pink, and a deep plum. Each lipstick tube should be pristine and reflect light subtly, highlighting the MAC logo. Focus should be sharpest on the lipstick closest to the viewer, with a slight depth of field blurring the ones further back. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Add subtle gold glitter particles floating in the air to enhance the luxurious feel. The overall style should be modern, glamorous, and aspirational, reflecting the MAC brand aesthetic. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to the variety of lipstick shades."
