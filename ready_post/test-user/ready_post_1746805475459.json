    "image_prompt": "A visually striking, high-angle product shot showcasing three lipsticks from the \"test-user\" summer collection. The lipsticks are arranged diagonally across a clean, light-colored (off-white or very pale blush pink) textured surface, perhaps linen or a subtly textured paper. The lipsticks are different shades: a bright coral, a vibrant fuchsia, and a classic red. Each lipstick is partially uncapped, revealing the bullet of color.\n\nThe lighting is bright, natural-looking, and diffused, creating soft shadows that highlight the texture of the lipsticks and the background. There should be subtle highlights on the metallic casings of the lipsticks, giving them a luxurious feel.\n\nScattered around the lipsticks are a few delicate, fresh flower petals in complementary colors (e.g., a few coral rose petals near the coral lipstick). The composition should feel airy and light, evoking a sense of summer freshness. The overall style is clean, modern, and sophisticated, with a focus on showcasing the vibrant colors and textures of the lipsticks. The image should be high-resolution and sharply focused, with a shallow depth of field to subtly blur the background and draw attention to the lipsticks. The mood is playful, vibrant, and inviting, perfectly capturing the essence of summer beauty."
