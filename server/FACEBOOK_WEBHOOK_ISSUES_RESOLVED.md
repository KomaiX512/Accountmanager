# Facebook Webhook Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Missing Webhook Verification Endpoint
**Problem**: The modular server was missing dedicated Facebook webhook verification endpoints.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Added dedicated endpoints:
- `GET /webhook/facebook` - Webhook verification
- `GET /api/webhook/facebook` - Webhook verification (API route)
- `POST /webhook/facebook` - Receive webhook events
- `POST /api/webhook/facebook` - Receive webhook events (API route)

### 2. ‚ùå Personal Account Limitations
**Problem**: Personal Facebook accounts have very limited API access due to Facebook's privacy policies.

**Limitations for Personal Accounts**:
- ‚ùå No webhook support for DMs and comments
- ‚ùå Limited automated posting capabilities  
- ‚ùå No insights or analytics data
- ‚ùå Restricted API access for messaging

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Enhanced user guidance with clear limitations and recommendations.

### 3. ‚ùå Server Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Webhook endpoints were only available in modular server, not main server.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Started modular server and verified all endpoints work correctly.
